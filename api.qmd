## Design

General idea is to have a high level API for most user tasks, which wraps a lower level R6 API.

The high level API should have a main `parse()` entry point that returns the root `node` object. Since `node` objects are immutable, this can be an S3 object.

The library will have a few R6 classes that will mostly be invisible:

-   `Language`

-   `Tree` (mutable through `edit()`, very important. what happens if you edit a Tree attached to existing Nodes?)

-   `Parser` (some mutable options)

-   `Cursor` (fully mutable)

-   `Query` (mutable in some key functions it seems)

-   `Node` (immutable, probably S3 if we can?)

Mostly you will call `parse()` followed by various `` node_*()` `` calls.

If you need to do something fancier, like tree edits, then you need to use the R6 classes themselves. i.e. `Parser$new()`, `Parser$parse()` to get a `Tree` that you can then `Tree$edit()`.

## Language

Languages should probably be kept in a singleton environment in the `trees` namespace. It is probably not a good idea to give out multiple copies to the same underlying TSLanguage, although they are immutable so it may not be that bad.

Maybe this could still be S3? Although unloading one language would unload others.

``` r
#| eval = FALSE

# Language objects are immutable, so could be S3 objects

language

# Embedded R language object
language_r() -> language

# Build a language object from another source
# (Can we look up the language name from greping for `extern const TSLanguage *tree_sitter_r(void) {` in `parser.c`?)
language_from_url(x) -> language
language_from_github(x) -> language
language_from_local(x) -> language

# For the rare dyn.unload() case
# `x` can be a language object or language name
language_unload(x) -> bool

# Looking up language specific IDs and node kind names
language_id_for_node_kind(x, kind, named) -> int
language_node_kind_for_id(x, id) -> string

# What version of the API was this built with
language_version(x)

# Various other language metadata accessors
language_*()
```

## Parser

Can we avoid exposing the parser API at all? It looks like it is mutable but could be captured all in one constructor object.

`parse()` should convert `x` (a string) to UTF-8 before passing to C, so C function can assume UTF-8 encoding.

``` r
parse_text(
    x,
    ...,
    language = NULL
)
```

Should return a Tree object

Don't think we need to worry about logger, cancellation flag, included ranges, etc, but if we needed to they could go in the constructor

## Tree

``` r
tree_language(x) -> language
tree_root_node(x) -> node
tree_root_node_with_offset(x, offset) -> node

# makes use of tree_copy() under the hood to retain immutability?
# assuming that works (it only does a shallow copy so maybe not?)
tree_edit(x, edit)
```

## Edit

``` r
# all the fields required to make a tree_edit(), or just inline them into tree_edit()
# if we think this is the only place it will be used
new_edit(...)
```

## Cursor

Don't need this for now, but if we did add this then it would use an R6 class
